Hello!
The files in this folder are all my work done over the last few weeks. There are a few things I have to mention:
- MacOS users may face a bug, where the game will load, however when the start button is clicked, it will quit the program, to counter this, th best way is to just keep retrying until it works, or to restart the app, and sometimes switching to 'bash' interactive shell it can fix it.
- Players who want to add in their own data into the data.py file, please follow the template below and use the same site at the top of the data.py file,    both sites are similar and produce similar results, so either can be used.
Template for manual new data entries:

    {
        'name' : '',                #Name of search term goes here in ''
        'search_count': ,           #Number of searchs put before the ',', using the websites listed above
        'description': '',          #Short description of search term in ''
        'country': '',              #Country of origin of search term in ''
    },
    
Please enter this inside the [] brackets at the start and end, not outside the other data. The template can only be properly used when opened with a proper text editor, it appears strange in the github web view. Or press the raw button on the github website to view the proper template.

I hope you enjoy the game I have created!
